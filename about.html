            <p>The Student Work Experience Programme (SWEP) established by the Federal Government of Nigeria was aimed at exposing students of higher institutions (second and third-year engineering students) to acquire industrial skill and practical experience in their approved courses of study and also to prepare the students for the six-month Student Industrial Work Experience Scheme (SIWES) which also was aimed at preparing the students for the industrial work situation which they are likely to meet after graduation.</p>
            
            <p>This technical report is based on the experiences gained during my two months of industrial training at Olatunde Auto-Maintenance and Repair, Asa Dam, Ilorin, Kwara State. This report highlights how different vehicles are maintained and repaired in the various workshop sections. I was privileged to work in eight (7) workshop sections which are: Vehicle dashboard indicators, wheels and tires, engine systems, electrical and electronic system, brakes system, Suspension system and Transmission system. These sections exposed me to the safety precautions, tools and equipment and vehicle diagnosis mechanisms. Most importantly, it describes the activities and my experience gained during the period of the training. Also, it states the problems encountered and gives suggestions for improvement on the scheme.</p>
